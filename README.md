ToolBoxes
===

This project is a collection of Docker / Vagrant files and additional scripts 
and settings, that will help to prepare vms and containers with different build 
tools, such as _gcc_, _clang_, _mingw64_, or _msbuild_ and others.

Those vms and containers might be used as build platform or extended further 
to provide wide variety of in-box developer environment.
